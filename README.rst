I started with the Nuclei-SDK package for Platform-IO, created a project from the freertos_demo example, then grafted the LCD library from Sipeed into it. It's a science fair project but got things going here.

You need to attempt the PlatformIO upload - this fails but creates the .hex file you then use the GD DFU tool externally to upload.
